# Windows Terminal

Windows Terminal is a modern host application for the command-line shells you already love,
like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and bash (via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)).
Its main features include multiple tabs, panes, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, a GPU accelerated text rendering engine,
and the ability to create your own themes and customize text, colors, backgrounds, and shortcuts.
